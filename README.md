## 🧩 Code Structure

The code is **in a single Python file**, **divided into functions** by topic.

Each function represents a different Python topic:

- Basic variable and output examples
- Output formatting (`sep`, `end`)
- Unicode and Hex character printing
- Data type conversions
- Variable usage examples
- Monthly travel expense calculation

The program's execution is controlled by the `if __name__ == “__main__”:` block.
