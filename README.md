# Python-first-codes
This repository contains my first Python projects, which are small exercises I completed as part of a learning course.  
The projects are designed to practice basic Python programming concepts such as input/output, calculations, and simple logic.

## Projects Included

1. **Date of Birth Calculator**  
   - A simple program that asks the user for their birth date and calculates their age.
   
2. **Travel Expense Calculator**  
   - A program to calculate travel costs based on distance, fuel consumption, and other expenses.
   
3. **Average Calculator**  
   - Calculates the average of a list of numbers entered by the user.

## Purpose

These exercises helped me practice:
- Python syntax and basic commands
- Using variables and performing calculations
- Working with user input
- Writing clear and simple programs
